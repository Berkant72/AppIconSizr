# AppIconSizr

With Xcode 14 you can choose all sizes or just one size except for macOS, where you still need all sizes. If you are using an older version of Xcode, you will need all sizes for your app icons.

AppIconSizr is the easiest way to convert your app icons in all sizes. Just click on the placeholder image and select your app icon. In the next step, select the operating system you want. Then you can save your icons in different sizes with the export function on your hard drive.
